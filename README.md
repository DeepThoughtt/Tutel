# Tutel
Small app to convert big amounts of files from an extension to another

## How does it work?
Start the program, write the directory where the files you want to convert are stored and pick the extension you want to convert into another, then press 
the start button. The program will modify the extension and save the original files in a newly created folder. If you wish you can also convert the files in
the subfolders, just check the corresponding option. This program is intended to convert big amounts of files like you would do manually changing the extension at
the end of the file's name.
